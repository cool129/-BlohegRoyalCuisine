Special Dish

Rice With Stew

I've been perfecting this beef stew recipe for years, and it's become a family favorite. Tender chunks of beef simmered with hearty vegetables create a comforting meal that's perfect for chilly evenings. Served over fluffy rice, this dish strikes balance between rich flavors and satisfying textures. What sets my version apart is patience - allowing time for ingredients to meld creates depth unmatched by rushed alternatives. Trust me, your taste buds will thank you for giving this stew a try!

Ground Egusi Seeds – This nutty base thickens the soup perfectly; if you can’t find egusi, try ground melon seeds instead. Palm Oil – Adds a rich, comforting flavor; substitute with vegetable oil for a lighter touch. Onion – Essential for sweetness and depth; use yellow or white onions for best results. Locust Beans – Provides that savory umami flavor; you can replace it with ogiri or omit if it’s unavailable. Chopped Spinach – Brings nutrition and color; swap with bitter leaf or kale based on your taste. Beef Broth – Forms the soup base; for lighter dishes, use chicken broth or vegetable stock. Mixed Meats (e.g., beef, goat, smoked fish) – Adds protein and flavor; feel free to use your favorite type of meat or make it vegetarian. Seasoning Powder (e.g., Vegetable Stock, Salt) – Enhances overall flavor; adjust to suit your palate. Fresh Pepper – Suitable for adding a kick; vary the amount based on your spice preference.
